# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

DramaCommerce AI is a React Router 8 full-stack app. A merchant uploads a product image plus a short brief (audience, mood, platform, duration); the app runs an AI "showrunner" pipeline that produces a story concept, hook, voice-over, a 5-scene storyboard with video prompts, an editing timeline, a social caption/CTA, and can kick off a real text-to-video render for scene 1 via Alibaba Cloud's Wan model.

## Commands

Package manager is **pnpm** (see `pnpm-lock.yaml` and the Dockerfile).

- `pnpm dev` — start the dev server (React Router dev, HMR) at `http://localhost:5173`
- `pnpm run typecheck` — runs `react-router typegen` then `tsc` (regenerate route types before type-checking after changing `app/routes.ts` or route loader/action signatures)
- `pnpm run build` — production build
- `pnpm run start` — serve the production build (`react-router-serve ./build/server/index.js`)

There is no test suite and no lint script configured in `package.json`.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Two separate Alibaba Cloud DashScope surfaces are used with different base URLs:

- `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`, `QWEN_BASE_URL` (includes `/compatible-mode/v1` — OpenAI-compatible chat completions), `QWEN_MODEL` — for the showrunner planning step.
- `DASHSCOPE_VIDEO_BASE_URL` (no `/compatible-mode/v1` suffix — uses `/api/v1/services/...` and `/api/v1/tasks/...`), `WAN_VIDEO_MODEL`, `WAN_VIDEO_RESOLUTION`, `WAN_VIDEO_RATIO`, `WAN_VIDEO_DURATION` — for Wan video generation.

If Qwen env vars are missing or the Qwen call fails, the app falls back to a deterministic mock generator rather than erroring — this is intentional (see Architecture below), not a bug to "fix" by making it throw.

## Architecture

### Pipeline: brief → showrunner → project → video

1. `routes/generate.tsx` (`action`) collects the form/multipart submission, saves the uploaded image via `services/image-upload.server.ts`, calls `services/showrunner.server.ts#generateShowPlan`, persists the result with `services/project-store.server.ts#saveProject`, and redirects to `/projects/:id`.
2. `services/showrunner.server.ts#generateShowPlan` tries the Qwen path first (`generateQwenShowPlan` → `services/qwen.server.ts#callQwenJson` → validated by `services/showrunner-validator.server.ts` with a Zod schema) and falls back to `generateMockShowPlan` on any failure, tagging the result's `source` field as `"qwen"` or `"mock"` so the UI can show which path was used.
3. The mock path runs four small pure "agent" functions in sequence, each consuming/producing the shared `ShowPlan`-related types from `app/types/showrunner.ts`:
   - `agents/story-agent.server.ts` — brief → `StoryPackage` (concept, hook, voice-over)
   - `agents/director-agent.server.ts` — brief + story → `DirectedScene[]` (5 fixed scenes with visuals/durations)
   - `agents/prompt-agent.server.ts` — scenes → `StoryboardScene[]` (adds a text-to-video `videoPrompt` per scene)
   - `agents/editor-agent.server.ts` — storyboard → `EditorPackage` (timeline, caption, CTA)
   - The Qwen path asks the model to produce the same shape directly in one JSON call instead of running these four steps.
4. `routes/projects.tsx` lists saved projects; `routes/projects.$projectId.tsx` shows one project's full plan and drives Wan video generation for scene 1 only (`intent=create-video-task` / `intent=refresh-video-task` form actions call `services/wan-video.server.ts`, and job state is stored via `services/project-store.server.ts#saveVideoJob`). Only scene 1 gets a video job by design, to keep the MVP cheap and predictable.

### Storage

No database — `services/project-store.server.ts` persists everything to a single `data/projects.json` file (read-modify-write, no locking; fine for single-instance MVP only). Uploaded images are written to `uploads/` on local disk and served back through `routes/uploads.$filename.tsx`, which guards against path traversal by rejecting filenames containing `/` or `..`. Both `data/` and `uploads/` are gitignored.

### Types

`app/types/showrunner.ts` is the shared contract (`ProductBrief`, `StoryPackage`, `DirectedScene`, `StoryboardScene`, `EditorPackage`, `ShowPlan`) that every agent, the Qwen validator, and both route UIs depend on — check this file first when changing the shape of generated data.

### Route conventions

Routes are registered explicitly in `app/routes.ts` (not filesystem-based) using `@react-router/dev/routes`. `.server.ts` suffixes mark server-only modules (agents, services) that must not be imported from client-rendered code.
